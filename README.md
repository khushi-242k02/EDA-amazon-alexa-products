# EDA of amazon alexa products
EDA or exploratory data analysis is a process that is used to analyze and investigate data sets and summarize their main characteristics. It describes the data by means of statistical and visualization techniques in order to bring important aspects of the data. Here I have performed the EDA on the data set of amazon alexa products that is taken by Kaggle. The link of the dataset is given below.

The dataset consists of a nearly 3000 Amazon customer reviews (input text), star ratings, date of review, variant and feedback of various amazon Alexa products like Alexa Echo, Echo dots, Alexa Firesticks etc.
